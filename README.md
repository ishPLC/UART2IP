# UART2IP
# UART Terminal to IP (UART PLC data transfer to IP)

This is a set of applications that allows you to transfer data from the PLC through the UART interface to a PC and then transfer data over the network to other PCs where socket clients (IP, Port) are installed. Socket server and clients are used. I used Arduino as a PLC.
